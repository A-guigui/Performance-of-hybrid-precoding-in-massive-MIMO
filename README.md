# Performance-of-hybrid-precoding-in-massive-MIMO

This project investigates two different hybrid precoding design methods Zero forcing (ZF)and Minimum mean square error (MMSE) that can drastically reduce the cost, complexity and power consumption while approaching the optimal performance for massive MIMO systems.
